# measures of data

## count

number of items/observations in a set

### the measure is a large number?

large dataset

### the measure is a very small?

small dataset

## Range of the dataset

The difference between the highest and lowest value in a dataset.

### large range

there dataset is very diverse or has outliers

### small range

the dataset is clustered together with no outliers

## Mean

the sum of all elements / the number of elements average in common english

### the measure is a large number

The average value is large, either some there are some large outliers or the values group around large

### the measure is a very small

same but small values (with values often unable to be negative, it is less susceptible to low outliers)

## Variance

The mean of the squares of the deviation from the mean.

Gives an idea of how spread out a set of data is (dispersion)

it measures the square of how far from the median a random datapoint can be expected

### large varience

random samples can be expected to be far from the mean

### small variance

random samples can be expected to be close to the mean.

## Median

the middle value of a data set (equal number of values above and below), if there are an even number of values the mean
of the 2 values if the data is fairly normal in distribution this works a lot like an average but is resistant to
outliers

### Small Median

it means the center value of the sorted dataset is small, if the set doesn't have multiple peaks of frequency it means
the typical value is small

### Large median

Same as above but large

## Mode

the value that appears most often in a set of data values in skewed data it can be more useful than mean or median

### the measure is a large number

the most common case is a large value

### the measure is a very small

the most common case is a small value

## Standard Deviation

Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. This is useful because it brings the unit back to what was
measured (a standard deviation of 3 feet is more usefule than a stadard deviation of 9 square feet when analyzing
length)

### meaning

the meaning is the same as with variance, it is simply in the same unit as the original sample

## Standard Error of the Mean

This is a measure of if the sample size is large enough to be useful.

it measures how far the sample mean is likely to be from the population mean

for datasets with large variance more samples are needed.

### large standard error

not enough data, more data points will likely alter the sample mean

### small standard error

a large enough dataset to have confidence in the sample mean

## Correlation

How much a change in value in one list is related to a change in value in the second for the same position

### a high correlation (close to 1)

means the two are very much moving together

### a low correlation (close to -1)

means the first number increasing reduces the second number

### a correlation close to 0

means the two numbers have no impact on each other.
